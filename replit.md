## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Technology Stack**: Pure HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript
- **CSS Framework**: Bootstrap 5.3.0 (CDN-based)
- **Icons**: Font Awesome 6.4.0 (CDN-based)
- **Architecture Pattern**: Multi-page static website with shared navigation and styling
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach using Bootstrap's grid system

### Key Components

#### HTML Structure
- **Multi-page Layout**: Separate HTML files for different sections (index, company, services, blog, testimonials, contact)
- **Consistent Navigation**: Fixed-top navbar with dropdown menus across all pages
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper use of HTML5 semantic elements for accessibility and SEO

#### CSS Organization
- **Custom CSS Variables**: Centralized theming system in `:root` for consistent colors and styling
- **Component-based Styling**: Modular CSS approach with utility classes
- **Bootstrap Integration**: Custom styles that extend Bootstrap's default styling
- **Color Scheme**: Professional blue-based palette (`--primary-color: #0052cc`)

#### JavaScript Functionality
- **Modular Structure**: Functions organized by feature (navigation, forms, animations)
- **Event-driven**: DOM event listeners for user interactions
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript
- **Bootstrap Integration**: Utilizes Bootstrap's JavaScript components for dropdowns and modals

### Data Flow

#### Static Content Flow
1. **HTML Templates**: Each page contains static content with shared navigation structure
2. **CSS Cascade**: Global styles from Bootstrap → Custom CSS variables → Component-specific styles
3. **JavaScript Enhancement**: Progressive enhancement for interactive features like smooth scrolling and form validation

#### User Interaction Flow
1. **Navigation**: Users browse through different pages via navbar links
2. **Forms**: Contact forms collect user information (likely processed server-side or via external service)
3. **Responsive Behavior**: Layout adapts to different screen sizes using Bootstrap breakpoints

### External Dependencies

#### CDN Dependencies
- **Bootstrap 5.3.0**: UI framework for responsive design and components
- **Font Awesome 6.4.0**: Icon library for visual elements
- **No Backend Dependencies**: Currently a static website with no server-side processing

#### Potential Integrations
- **Form Processing**: Contact forms may require backend service or third-party integration
- **Analytics**: Ready for Google Analytics or similar tracking services
- **Newsletter**: Newsletter signup functionality may need email service integration

### Deployment Strategy

#### Current Setup
- **Static Hosting**: Designed for deployment on static hosting platforms (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel)
- **CDN Reliance**: External dependencies loaded from CDNs for performance
- **No Build Process**: Direct deployment of source files without compilation

#### Scalability Considerations
- **Asset Organization**: Clear separation of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
- **Maintainable Structure**: Consistent file naming and organization
- **SEO Ready**: Proper meta tags and semantic HTML structure
- **Performance Optimized**: Minimal custom JavaScript and CSS, leveraging Bootstrap for most styling

### Technical Decisions

#### Framework Choice
- **Problem**: Need for responsive, professional-looking website quickly
- **Solution**: Bootstrap 5 with custom CSS for branding
- **Rationale**: Rapid development, proven responsive design patterns, minimal learning curve

#### Static vs Dynamic
- **Problem**: Immigration consultation website with primarily informational content
- **Solution**: Static website approach
- **Rationale**: Lower hosting costs, better security, faster loading times, easier maintenance

#### Multi-page vs SPA
- **Problem**: Multiple distinct content sections (about, services, contact, etc.)
- **Solution**: Traditional multi-page website
- **Rationale**: Better SEO, simpler navigation, easier content management, familiar user experience
